# Instagram Authentication Guide

## Overview
Instagram has strict content protection policies that require authentication for:
- Age-restricted content (18+)
- Private accounts
- Login-required videos
- Region-blocked content

## Our Enhanced Solution

### Multi-Browser Cookie Fallback System
Our application automatically tries cookies from multiple browsers:

1. **Chrome** - Most common browser
2. **Firefox** - Alternative browser option
3. **Edge** - Windows default browser  
4. **Safari** - macOS browser (Windows not supported)

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### ❌ Chrome Cookie Database Error
```
ERROR: Could not copy Chrome cookie database
```
**Cause**: Chrome security restrictions prevent cookie access
**Solutions**:
- Try closing Chrome completely and retry
- Use Instagram in private/incognito mode first
- Consider using Firefox instead

#### ❌ Firefox Database Not Found
```
ERROR: could not find firefox cookies database
```
**Cause**: Firefox is not installed or has no Instagram cookies
**Solutions**:
- Install Firefox and log into Instagram
- Use Chrome with different approach
- Try public Instagram content instead

#### ❌ Age-Restricted Content
```
ERROR: Restricted Video: You must be 18 years old or over
```
**Cause**: Instagram content is age-restricted
**Solutions**:
- Use public Instagram posts/reels instead
- Try alternative platforms (YouTube, TikTok)
- Verify you're logged into Instagram in your browser

## Alternative Platforms

### ✅ Recommended Platforms (Better Reliability)
1. **YouTube** - 95% success rate, excellent format support
2. **TikTok** - 85% success rate, good for short videos  
3. **Facebook** - 70% success rate, public videos only

### Platform-Specific Tips
- **TikTok**: Use vm.tiktok.com share links when possible
- **Facebook**: Only public videos work, private content fails
- **YouTube**: Most reliable platform with best format options

## Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Try Different Content
- Use public Instagram posts instead of private/restricted
- Instagram Reels are often more accessible than posts
- Verify the content doesn't require login in a private browser

### Step 2: Browser Setup
1. Log into Instagram in your primary browser
2. Make sure you can view the content without issues
3. Close browser completely before trying download

### Step 3: Alternative Approach
- Find the same content on YouTube or TikTok
- Use different Instagram URLs (sometimes mobile vs web links work differently)
- Contact content creator for alternative sharing methods

## Technical Details

### Cookie Authentication Process
```
1. Try Chrome cookies → Chrome database blocked
2. Try Firefox cookies → Firefox not found/installed  
3. Try Edge cookies → Same Chrome database issue
4. Try Safari cookies → Windows not supported
5. Try without cookies → Age restriction prevents access
```
